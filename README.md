Forgács Péter és Haraszti Péter Brúnó Attila 4. védése Magas szintű programozási nyelvekből


Brúnó - Koppány
===============

We united the two task into one. The viewer shows the correct way (e.g. Not the stops are connected with Malvin), so we have nice turns and always stays on the road. We made the viewer more user friendly and added customizable options. You can specify the line's width or color, you can enable/disable to automaticly calc best zoom to a way, select tiles (satalite/hybrid) and more.


Petra
=====

For Petra we have two versions.
The first is where we wrote an algorithm to calculate the route from A to B.

In the second we used boost to do the same. We intended it to be a little comparison, so you can compare the results, runtime, path and visited nodes too.


Malvin
======

Malvin: The output is tailored for our viewer.

MalvinDetails: The output is ordered by the buses, and for each stop we write the stops's name (usually the stop's street) and it's GPS location.
